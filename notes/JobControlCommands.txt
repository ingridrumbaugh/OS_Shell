jobs
- lists the jobs running in the background, giving job number

disown 
- remove job(s) from shell's table of active jobs 

fg, bg 
- fg switches a job running in background --> foreground
- bg restarts a suspended job and runs it in the background 
- if no job #, then fg or bg acts on currently running job 

wait 
- Suspend script exec until all background jobs have terminated 
- or specify PID and will exec after it terminates

- similar to Ctrl-Z but suspends the shell 

logout 
- exit a login shell 

times

kill

kill -l lists all signals 
kill -9 is a sure kill which terminates a process that refuses to die
